# ARIMA-GARCH Stock Price Volatility Prediction

## 1. Introduction

Predicting the movement of the stock market is not an easy task, as it is influenced by a multitude of factors. One way to achieve this is by building stock market prediction models, which use historical data and advanced analytical techniques to forecast future market trends.

There are a variety of methods and models to be used as stock market prediction models that are used widely among many projects. In this project, I will investigate the effectiveness of ARIMA and GARCH (GJR-GARCH) models, then combine them to create an ARIMA-GARCH model.


## 2. Prediction Models

To predict volatility of the stock price, I will build ARIMA and GARCH model, combine them together, then apply for the (monthly) price change and the percentage returns of a stock of a Vietnamese company. The full code to all the steps and models can be found in this repository.

Result:
